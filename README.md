Sorting Visualizer
Sorting Visualizer is a web application that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides an interactive and visual representation of how different sorting algorithms work on an array of bars.

Features
Visualize various sorting algorithms: The Sorting Visualizer supports popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.

Adjustable speed and array size: Users can adjust the speed of the sorting animation and choose the size of the array to see how different algorithms perform under different conditions.

Real-time feedback: During the sorting process, the application provides real-time feedback by highlighting the bars that are being compared and swapped.

Random array generation: Users can generate a new random array to observe how different sorting algorithms handle different initial conditions.

How to Use
Choose the sorting algorithm: Select the sorting algorithm you want to visualize from the available options.

Set the array size: Use the slider to adjust the size of the array.

Adjust the speed: Use the slider to set the speed of the sorting animation.

Generate a new array: Click the "Generate New Array" button to create a new random array.

Visualize the sorting process: Click the "Sort" button to start the sorting animation and observe how the selected algorithm sorts the array.

Technologies Used
React.js: The front-end of the application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

JavaScript: The sorting algorithms and other application logic are implemented using JavaScript.

CSS: The user interface is styled using CSS for a visually appealing experience.

HTML: The structure of the application is created using HTML elements.
