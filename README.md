<b>Sorting Visualizer</b> is a web application that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides an interactive and visual representation of how different sorting algorithms work on an array of bars.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Visualize various sorting algorithms</b>: The Sorting Visualizer supports popular sorting algorithms like <b>Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort</b>.<br></li>

<li><b>Adjustable speed and array size</b>: Users can adjust the speed of the sorting animation and choose the size of the array to see how different algorithms perform under different conditions.<br></li>

<li><b>Real-time feedback</b>: During the sorting process, the application provides real-time feedback by highlighting the bars that are being compared and swapped.<br></li>

<li><b>Random array generation</b>: Users can generate a new random array to observe how different sorting algorithms handle different initial conditions.<br></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Use</h2>
<ul>
  
<li>Choose the sorting algorithm: Select the sorting algorithm you want to visualize from the available options.</li>

<li>Set the array size: Use the slider to adjust the size of the array.</li>

<li>Adjust the speed: Use the slider to set the speed of the sorting animation.</li>

<li>Generate a new array: Click the <i>"Generate New Array"</i> button to create a new random array.</li>

<li>Visualize the sorting process: Click the <i>"Sort"</i> button to start the sorting animation and observe how the selected algorithm sorts the array.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>React.js</b>: The front-end of the application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</li>

<li><b>JavaScript</b>: The sorting algorithms and other application logic are implemented using JavaScript.</li>

<li><b>CSS</b>: The user interface is styled using CSS for a visually appealing experience.</li>

<li><b>HTML</b>: The structure of the application is created using HTML elements.</li>
</ul>
